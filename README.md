# Project-Gutenberg
In this project, we will do some interesting analysis on some of the most famous literature works while honing our skills working with strings, arrays, hash tables, trees, and more!

Project Gutenberg (http://www.gutenberg.org/) is a massive online effort to digitize and archive popular books as a way to encourage the creation and distribution of eBooks. Over 57,000 of the world’s greatest literature have been digitized. 

Many of these digitized works have been added to the GITenberg github repo (https://github.com/GITenberg/). 

## Questions:
 1. Choose the novel that you want to work with on this project. Be sure to pick a novel that has clearly defined Chapters (ie, somewhere in the text it says Chapter 1 , Chapter 2, etc) as we will need to analyze things by chapters in future steps.
 2. Implement your own algorithms to perform text analysis on the novel.
 3. Analyze the progression of the words used on a chapter-by-chapter basis.
 4. Implement a way for us to find out what chapter a certain quote from the book can be found in.
 5. Write a sentence in the author’s voice by implementing a method named generateSentence()
 6. Sentence Completion / Prediction with Tries (OPTIONAL)
