# Project-Gutenberg
In this project, we will do some interesting analysis on some of the most famous literature works while honing our skills working with strings, arrays, hash tables, trees, and more!

Project Gutenberg (http://www.gutenberg.org/) is a massive online effort to digitize and archive popular books as a way to encourage the creation and distribution of eBooks. Over 57,000 of the world’s greatest literature have been digitized. 

Many of these digitized works have been added to the GITenberg github repo (https://github.com/GITenberg/).
